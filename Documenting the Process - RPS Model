Using Teachable Machines I grabbed ~400 images for each of the three main poses (rock, paper and scissors) and ~300 for 'nothing'.  

In testing on the website, the camera is able to correctly identify each pose with a reasonable degree of accuracy.  
I do no know how many images would be needed to increase the accuracy further. 
When identifying the 'pose', the focus seemed to be on my facial features and shoulder position more so than the hand/fingers.  
It wasn't immediately apparent if I could change the focus to the hand/fingers in the settings I was able to change.  

The code output from the model is: 
[code]
<div>Teachable Machine Pose Model</div>
<button type="button" onclick="init()">Start</button>
<div><canvas id="canvas"></canvas></div>
<div id="label-container"></div>

The next stages in the process will be to install various softwares to allow me to use this code on my computer.  
Once this has been done I will need to write the necessary python code to recognise a player input of rock, paper or scissors.  
Finally, this user input will be compared to a computer choice to determine a winner. 

I have found this an enjoyable project thus far, but as I am also attempting to work through the hangman project at the same time I am having serious doubts
regarding the time it will take for me to feel confident using python to the level I am expected to use it on this course.
